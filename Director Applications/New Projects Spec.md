# DevSoc New Projects Pitch Specification

## Overview and problem statement
Students and societies face  arious challenges in managing their time, resources, and knowledge -- whether academically or in their organizational activities. While many software tools aim to address these issues, they often fall short of meeting the unique needs of the student community.

**Aim:** Develop a unique software project that addresses a specific challenge faced by students or societies. This challenge could be academic, organizational, social, or related to personal development. 

We encourage you to think beyond existing solutions and build something original that genuinely helps the student community.

**Key requirements include:**
- The solution should be tailored to a real problem or need faced by students.
- It must be free and open to all, without any form of monetization.
- The project should offer a fresh approach or tool that makes students' lives easier or more effective, either academically or in everyday tasks.


## Pitch specification
As a pair (or individually), you will be given **5 Minutes** to pitch your project idea in a presentation form to the DevSoc executives and other entrants.

You may choose to answer some of the questions below in your pitch -- note that these only suggestions and you are free to structure your pitch in any other way.

### Background
