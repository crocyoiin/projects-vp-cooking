## Subcommittee Recruitment

### Things to consider
- FE/BE ratio suits your needs
- skill level? (how many of each? what are you looking for?)
- Graduation date (consider the longevity of the society, director ambitions?)
- Fresh blood good (complete non-returners)
- General recc is that trainees are generally a good pick :D

### Restrictions
- Numbers: MAX 7, reminder that you can take in trainees
- Gender ratio: AIM for 50/50, final depends on numbers
- Returners: Max/at least 2, definition = same port for >= 2 terms

### Trainee Recruitment
- let them know that regarding trainees they can decide how to handle the term 2 recruitment and if they want to reserve spots for trainees instead of taking them now when they be less available


## Marketing needs
- What are your plans for marketing this term?
    - What week? What kind of posts?

- Reminder that marketing exists! They require a `>= 2 week` notice so plan ahead!
- You can also make your own posts (surely projects reels :eyes:) to lessen the load, make sure you pass them to marketing for approval/feedback first

## Operation needs
- Have you reached out to platforms and know what they do for your project? 
    - If so, what are they currently doing?
    - Will you be needing any infrastructure changes anytime soon? Reminder that you should reach out to platforms before applying them for review. Feel free to generally message them if you're unsure.

- Any UI/UX needs? 
    - Ideally any visual design elements should go through them (so they actually have something to do lol)
    - If FE subcom have any new elements they are designing it might be nice to have them go through review with UI/UX

## Actionables
### Pre-Subcom preparation
- Onboarding preparation
    - Documentation (setup, run, building/staging, PRs)
    - Dryrun, we're thinking of having directors dryrun each others' onboarding

- Task Preparation
    - Set up github issues/projects (atl suite kinda exxy...)
    - Create tickets for goals AND beginner tasks
        - 1 beginner + 1 goal per subcom

### Post-subcom considerations (week 1 of having subcom)
- Have first meeting and finalize general meeting time
- First in person bonding planned OR completed
- Complete onboarding
- Use #small-wins to glaze subcom :D

- Project Directors Checkpoint 0: Week 5 Monday night (tent)

### Exec plans
